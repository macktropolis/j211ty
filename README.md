# Jammin' to Eleventy
> Created by Mack Richardson ([@macktropolis](https://github.com/macktropolis))

## Overview
Jammin' to Eleventy is a Jamstack site framework meant to get your site up and running quickly with 11ty and SASS.
## Quick Start

1. [Generate a repo from this template](https://github.com/macktropolis/jammin-to-eleventy/generate)
   which will copy this project into your own new repo.

1. Once cloned, run `npm install` to install 11ty and other dependencies. Then run `npm start` to run both 11ty and sass in watch
   mode. Use `npm run build` to run a production version, which will also generate social share
   preview images.

1. Open `src/_data/site.json` and adjust the values to your details.

1. Review the [styling documentation](https://5t3ph.github.io/html-sass-jumpstart/) for the included minimal
   Sass framework, particularly the theme variables, to quickly customize the starter.

1. Edit `_includes/home.njk` to change the home page - including changing the template type if desired -
   and then create content within `_pages` using any templating format you prefer to add content.

1. Check out the [About page](https://11ty-netlify-jumpstart.netlify.app/about/) for expanded details on included features of this starter.

1. Review the [11ty documentation](https://11ty.dev) to more deeply apply customizations, including
   adding custom data sources and reviewing what template languages are available.

### Is Netlify hosting required?

It's not required, but highly recommended, and is also how the build process is setup to run
against.

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS and social preview image generation

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.
